//
//Naming Constants & Variables
//
//Constant and variable names can start with any upper or lower-case letter, an underscore, _, or dollar character, $. 
//Thy can also contain numbers, but cannot start with them.

//	Here are some valid examples:
//	$name
//	_answer
//	firstName
//	last_name
//	address_line1
//

// just fallow the same convention as you allways have in all your  python 3 stuff
// 

// strings
//
// you can construrct strings in difret ways
//
Astring = new String("hello")
$string = 'this is a string'

console.log(Astring);
console.log($string);


// properties using dictionary like notation instead of . Notation

console.log(Astring["length"]);
console.log(Astring.length);

// why would you use one over the other? just seems redundant to me.  

//did know you could do this :) neat.
let new_num = 0xAFF
console.log(new_num);
